\section*{\hspace{-.5cm} Problem Background}

\subsection*{\hspace{-.5cm} Problem Statement}\label{intro}
Our client, The District Comapny, has asked us to use data analytics to explore their event data. We are going to use this information to determine if the events they are holding bring in extra business and revenue to their company. We specifically want to analyze the correlation between their events and concession sales.

\subsection*{\hspace{-.5cm} Why is the Problem Important to the Client?}\label{tech} 
This is an important problem to the company because it will allow the company to make important business decisions based on the data to maximize profit.

\subsection*{\hspace{-.5cm}Plan of Action}\label{tech}
We will be conducting a survey of short questions to understand consumers more effectively.
