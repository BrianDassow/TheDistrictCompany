I&#039;ll go to whichever Main Street store is offering the Magic formats that I want to play, but District is definitely my go-to.', 'I miss Levi runing the old card shop the new owners don&#039;t deal with footbll or baseball cards, so now there&#039;s no one to buy or trade cards with Levi gone.', 'I&#039;ve got to say, have been out of collecting cards since middle school and was looking to get back at it. After all, 14&#039; was a great year to start, with the draft class n all. So I took the drive to see Levi &#064;Card sharks, and man is he full of knowledge in cards. Needless to say, he gave me a brush up and I was off to the races. I bought a 14&#039; Panini Prizm jumbo box and started cracking packs. I pulled several nice autos, and inserts and was overall happy with the buy until... Last pack, wouldn&#039;t you know it, Johnny Football himself auto #&#039;d to 75, gold refractor! Thanks again Levi.', 'By far the best card shop in Menominee, and the surrounding area. Owner is an outstanding guy, and I am always happy to bring my business there.', 'First Class Customer service.

Boosters are slightly cheaper then at Wal-mart and that is awesome. Its pretty laid back there and to top it off they sell Surge there!', 'Beautiful shop that goes out of it&#039;s way to make its&#039; customers happy.  Great product, great prices and tons of fun events.  Hands down the best card shop I&#039;ve ever been to.', 'Great shop, professional and super clean. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.', 'Love this place! My grade school age son loves going in there - Levi is great with the kids that come in!']\n"
